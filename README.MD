# Shopping Manager
#### Video Demo: 
#### Description:

**Shopping Manager** is a collaborative shopping list web application designed to streamline the way households manage their shopping tasks. Built with Python, Flask, and SQLite, this application enables multiple users within a household to create, update, and share shopping lists in real-time, promoting better coordination and time-saving during grocery or general shopping activities.

Each user belongs to a household. A household is a group of users managed by a single admin. The admin holds control over household-level settings including the household name and member management. Regular members, however, can still contribute by adding items to shared shopping lists, marking items as purchased, or deleting items they've added. These changes are immediately visible to all members of the household, enabling truly collaborative list management.

The application also supports user personalization through display names (separate from login usernames) and customizable profile pictures — users can choose between DiceBear-generated avatars or uploading their own images. To join a household, users must provide a unique household code that only the household admin has access to, enhancing privacy and access control. Additionally, members can leave a household whenever they want.

This project was built as the final submission for CS50x, and showcases a range of full-stack web development skills, from secure authentication to real-time interaction and frontend enhancements using JavaScript.

  - Registration and login functionality using Flask-Login.
  - Session management and password hashing.

- **Household Management**
  - Admin-controlled household creation.

  - Each item tracks who added it and when.
  - Items can be marked as purchased, unpurchased, or deleted.
  - All lists are accessible to all users in the household.

- **User Personalization**
  - Custom display names separate from usernames.
  - Profile picture support via:
    - DiceBear avatars(still a bit buggy)
    - Uploaded image files

- **Frontend and UX Enhancements**
  - Responsive design using Bootstrap and custom CSS.
  - Modals for risky actions like deletion and leaving a household.
  - Inline editing of item names(triggered by double-clicking) using JavaScript.
  - Toast notifications for actions.
  - Clean and intuitive  card-based dashboard layout.
  - Progress Bar that updates instantaneously showing percentage of goods marked as purchased.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Database**: SQLite (with SQLAlchemy ORM)
- **Templating**: Jinja2
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap), JavaScript
- **Forms**: Flask-WTF in most, but not all places
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login
- **Avatar Generation**: DiceBear Avatars API( Not sure if its the API, but I am using their service through a link on every image)
- **AI**: ChatGPT, Gemini(2.5 Pro) and Claude(3.7 Sonnet) I used them mostly for debugging and advice/guidance especially at the beginning where I was not so comfortable with Flask and Javascript. However, all features and design choices were my own

## Design Decisions

- **Backend**
    - Blueprint Architecture: The project was divided into Flask blueprints for authentication, shopping, and household logic. This keeps the code modular, readable, and maintainable.
    - Flask-WTF Forms: Chosen for its CSRF protection and easy integration with Flask. It also simplifies form validation.
    - DiceBear Avatar Support: To offer personalization without requiring all users to upload images. A fallback for users who want a quick profile setup. All users have their initials set as their profile picture by default.
    - JavaScript UX Enhancements: JavaScript was used to enable features like inline editing, toggle item status without reloading, and confirmation modals to reduce accidental actions.
    - Role-based Control: Admin rights were enforced server-side to protect routes and functionality from unauthorized users.

- **Frontend(I really enjoyed this but it was also very time-consuming)**
    - Rounded Corners: I have always had a knack of using rounded corners whenever I can because I feel like it makes interfaces more "friendly".
    - Full width buttons: I did this for the sake of consistency, to help with long text within them and also so that they could be resized easily based on the size of the parent container on a given screen size. I also though that in some places, they looked quite good, although I have to admit that some do  look kind of odd.
    - Bootstrap: Not ready to re-invent the wheel when there is a perfectly working version. However, I didn't let it limit my creativity as I often(very often), overrode the default styles to fit what I thought they should look like and to get rid of that generic look.
    - Card-Based Layout: I love the clear separation it brings between different items.
    - Floaty-ness: I used box-shadows aaalot. I also thought it would be fit for elements to hover, well, on hover, from the cards to the buttons to the navigation bar. I'm also really proud of how the navigation bar turned out, it sticks to the top for usability, reacts to hover to make it feel alive, and has a beautiful frosted glass look.

## Limitations & Future Improvements

- Currently, only SQLite is supported — migrating to PostgreSQL would scale better.
- No  sticky notifications/emails implemented — could enhance onboarding or household invites.
- Would like to add  item history tracking and maybe budgeting tools and also emaiil verifcation of some sort.
- User search and invite system (by email or username) could replace the code-based household joining process.
- Currently, a user can only change their password but if they forget it, there is no way to recover.
- Would like to add search for lists and/or items. I had initially implemented it but it got time-consuming so I scrapped it.
- All the lists are shared meaning one cannot create a list for their own private use.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wazzicus/shopping-manager.git
   cd shopping-manager

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    Make sure to run Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass on Windows Powershell before activating venv when it gives you problems.

3. Set environment variables and run:
    export FLASK_APP=run.py
    export FLASK_ENV=development
    flask run

4. Visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser.
